# PhD thesis analyses

The analyses used in my [PhD thesis](https://github.com/PeteHaitch/phd_thesis). Each chapter has its own accompanying directory. 

__WARNING__: This repository does not contain the data files necessary for all analyses. I am trying to rectify this, but it is made difficult by two factors:

1. The data are large - raw data on the order of hundreds of gigabytes, and processed data on the order of tens of gigabytes.
2. I do not have permission to publish all the datasets since my collaborators have not yet published these.

I am exploring avenues for making available the processed data for those datasets for which I have permission.
